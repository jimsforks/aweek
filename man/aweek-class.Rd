\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{aweek}}

\item{...}{a series of \code{aweek} objects (unused in \code{print.aweek()})}

\item{i}{index for subsetting an aweek object.}

\value{
an object of class \code{aweek}
}
\description{
The aweek class is a character or factor in the format YYYY-Www(-d) with a
"week_start" attribute containing an integer specifying which day of the ISO
8601 week each week should begin. This documentation shows how to print or
subset the object.
}
\examples{
d <- as.Date("2018-12-20") + 1:40
w <- date2week(d, week_start = "Sunday")
print(w)

# subsetting acts as normal
w[1:10]

# Combining multiple aweek objects
c(w[1], w[3], w[5])

# differing week_start days will default to the attribute of the first 
# aweek object
mon <- date2week(Sys.Date(), week_start = "Monday")
mon
c(w, mon)
c(mon, w)

# combining Dates will be coerced to aweek objects under the same rules
c(w, Sys.Date())

# truncated aweek objects will be un-truncated
w2 <- date2week(d[1:5], week_start = "Monday", floor_day = TRUE)
w2
c(w[1:5], w2)
}
