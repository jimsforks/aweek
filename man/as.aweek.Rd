\description{
Convert characters or dates to aweek objects
}
\examples{

# aweek objects can only be created from valid weeks:

as.aweek("2018-W10-5", start = 7, week_start = 7) # works!
try(as.aweek("2018-10-5", week_start = 7)) # doesn't work :(

# you can also convert dates
as.aweek(as.Date("2018-03-09"))

# all functions get passed to date2week, so you can use any of its arguments:
as.aweek("2018-W10-5", start = 7, week_start = 7, floor_day = TRUE, factor = TRUE) 
as.aweek(as.Date("2018-03-09"), floor_day = TRUE, factor = TRUE)
}
